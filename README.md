# RMPE: Regional Multi-person Pose Estimation


### Introduction

RMPE is a two steps framework for the task of multi-person pose estimation. You can use the code to train/evaluate a model for pose estimation task. For more details, please refer to our paper.

### Installation
1. Get the code. We will call the directory that you cloned Caffe into `$CAFFE_ROOT`
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/anonymous-123/rmpe.git
  cd rmpe
  ```

2. Build the code. Please follow [Caffe instruction](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to install all necessary packages and build it.
  ```Shell
  # Modify Makefile.config according to your Caffe installation.
  cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
  make -j8
  # Make sure to include $CAFFE_ROOT/python to your PYTHONPATH.
  make py
  make test -j8
  make runtest -j8
  # If you have multiple GPUs installed in your machine, make runtest might fail. If so, try following:
  export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0; make runtest -j8
  # If you have error: "Check failed: error == cudaSuccess (10 vs. 0)  invalid device ordinal",
  # first make sure you have the specified GPUs, or try following if you have multiple GPUs:
  unset CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
  ```

### Preparation
#### For demo only
1. Download pre-trained human detector([Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxORzoJl8N9Pck8tZW1wMVlWNjA)|[Baidu cloud](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hssOFWS)) and SPPE+SSTN model([Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxORzoJl8N9PejV6OUZhUllzQWs)|[Baidu cloud](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1geVQkKj)). By default, we assume the models are stored in `$CAFFE_ROOT/models/VGG_SSD/` and `$CAFFE_ROOT/models/SPPE/` accordingly.

#### For train/eval
This part of our model is implemented in Torch7. Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/anonymous-123/multi-human-pose) for more details.

### Demo
Our experiments use both Caffe and Torch7. But we implement the whole framework in Caffe so you can run the demo easily.
1. Run the ipython notebook. It will show you how our whole framework works

  ```Shell
  cd $CAFFE_ROOT
  # it shows how our framework works
  jupyter notebook examples/rmpe/Regional\ Multi-person\ Pose\ Estimation.ipynb
  ```  
  
2. Run the python program for more results

  ```Shell
  python examples/rmpe/demo.py
  ```  

### Train/Eval

1. Train SPPE+SSTN.
This part of our model is implemented in Torch7. Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/anonymous-123/multi-human-pose) for more details.
We will call the directory that you cloned the repo into `$SPPE_ROOT`.
Note that I am currently working on an implementation in Caffe. The script may come out soon.


2. Evaluate the model. You can modify line 45 in `demo.py` to evaluate our framework on whole test set. But the results will be different from our work. To reproduce our results reported in our paper:
  ```Shell
  # First get the result of human detector
  cd $CAFFE_ROOT
  jupyter notebook examples/rmpe/human_detection.ipynb
  # Then move the results to $SPPE_ROOT/predict/annot/
  mv examples/rmpe/mpii-test0.09 $SPPE_ROOT/predict/annot/
  # Next, do single person human estimation
  cd $SPPE_ROOT/predict
  th main.lua predict-test
  #Finally, do pose NMS
  python batch_nms.py
  #our result is stored in txt format, to evaluate, Download MPII toolkit and put it in current directory
  matlab
  #In matlab
  setpred()
  ```
